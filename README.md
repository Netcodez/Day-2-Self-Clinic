word count, reverse string, a simple command line that consumes an API

Write a function called *words* that takes in a string argument and counts the occurrences of each word in the string.
The function should return a JSON object showing the words identified, and their occurrences.




Write a function *reverseString* that takes in a string argument and returns the reverse of the string provided.
If the reverse of the string is the same as the original string, as in the case of palindromes, return true instead.
